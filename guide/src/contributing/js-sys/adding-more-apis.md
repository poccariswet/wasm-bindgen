# Adding More APIs

The js-sys crate includes bindings for all APIs in the ECMAScript standard.

If you find a missing API or a new API has reached [TC39 stage 4][tc39], please [file an issue][issues].

For documentation on existing js-sys types, see the [js-sys](../../reference/types/js-sys.md) reference.
